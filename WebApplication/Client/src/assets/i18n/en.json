The larger the transaction volume, the higher the commission.<br><br>At any time during the lockup period, the investor can sell the tokens at the current price back to the smart contract and pick up the TRX. An investor can also keep tokens for himself or sell them on any crypto exchange. Also, the investor has the opportunity to buy tokens on a crypto exchange and sell them in a smart contract, but the amount is not more than its original purchase.<br><br>At the end of the lockup period, the project receives the remaining tokens and/or TRX from the smart contract."
